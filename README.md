# pinterest-callback

Simple oauth2 callback for pinterest.

This is definitely not production quality, so seriously do not copy this and use it. This is for a quick way to get an oauth2 auth code callback up and running for playing around with Pinterest APIs.

To use, export CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET with the app id and app secret from yur pinterest app, then update you app config with the resulting url.
